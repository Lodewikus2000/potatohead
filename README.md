# Mr. Potatohead

An immersive app that enables the user to play god over an innocent potato. Check the checkboxes to attach body parts to your victim potato, or uncheck the checkmarks to get rid of the body parts you just added.


__Update: Mr. Potatohead's state is now locally saved in sharedPreferences. (So the savedInstanceState is no longer used.)__
